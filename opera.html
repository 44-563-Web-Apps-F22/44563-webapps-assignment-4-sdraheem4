<h4>
A rocky seashore on the coast of Cornwall.  In the
distance is a calm sea, on which a schooner is lying at anchor.
Rock L. sloping down to L.C. of stage.  Under these rocks is a
cavern, the entrance to which is seen at first entrance L.  A
natural arch of rock occupies the R.C. of the stage.  As the
curtain rises groups of pirates are discovered — some drinking,
some playing cards.  SAMUEL, the Pirate Lieutenant, is going from
one group to another, filling the cups from a flask.  FREDERIC is
seated in a despondent attitude at the back of the scene.  RUTH
kneels at his feet.

ALL:      Pour, O pour the pirate sherry; Fill, O fill the pirate glass; And, to make us more than merry  Let the pirate bumper pass.


SAMUEL:   For today our pirate 'prentice Rises from indentures freed; Strong his arm, and keen his scent is He's a pirate now indeed!




ALL:      Here's good luck to Fred'ric's ventures!
Fred'ric's out of his indentures.

SAMUEL:   Two and twenty, now he's rising,
And alone he's fit to fly,
Which we're bent on signalizing
With unusual revelry.

ALL:      Here's good luck to Fred'ric's ventures!
Fred'ric's out of his indentures.
Pour, O pour the pirate sherry;
Fill, O fill the pirate glass;
And, to make us more than merry
Let the pirate bumper pass.

(FREDERIC rises and comes forward with PIRATE KING, who enters)

KING:     Yes, Frederic, from to-day you rank as a full-blown  member of our band.
                                                    
ALL:      Hurrah!
FREDERIC: My friends, I thank you all, from my heart, for your kindly wishes.  Would that I could repay them as they deserve!
KING:     What do you mean?
FREDERIC: To-day I am out of my indentures, and to-day I leave you for ever.
KING:     But this is quite unaccountable; a keener hand at scuttling a Cunarder or cutting out a White Star never shipped a handspike.
FREDERIC: Yes, I have done my best for you.  And why?  It was my duty under my indentures, and I am the slave of duty. As a child I was
       regularly apprenticed to your band.It was through an error — no matter, the mistake was ours, not yours, and I was in honour
       bound by it.
SAMUEL:   An error?  What error?  (RUTH rises and comes forward)
FREDERIC: I may not tell you; it would reflect upon my well-loved Ruth.
RUTH:     Nay, dear master, my mind has long been gnawed by the cankering tooth of mystery.  Better have it out at once.
