<h4>
A rocky seashore on the coast of Cornwall.  In the
distance is a calm sea, on which a schooner is lying at anchor.
Rock L. sloping down to L.C. of stage.  Under these rocks is a
cavern, the entrance to which is seen at first entrance L.  A
natural arch of rock occupies the R.C. of the stage.  As the
curtain rises groups of pirates are discovered — some drinking,
some playing cards.  SAMUEL, the Pirate Lieutenant, is going from
one group to another, filling the cups from a flask.  FREDERIC is
seated in a despondent attitude at the back of the scene.  RUTH
kneels at his feet.

       Yes, I have done my best for you.  And why?  It was my duty under my indentures, and I am the slave of duty. As a child I was
       regularly apprenticed to your band.It was through an error — no matter, the mistake was ours, not yours, and I was in honour
       bound by it.</p>

          Nay, dear master, my mind has long been gnawed by the cankering tooth of mystery.  Better have it out at once. </p>

              When Frederic was a little lad he proved so brave and
          daring,
     His father thought he'd 'prentice him to some career
          seafaring.
     I was, alas! his nurs'rymaid, and so it fell to my lot
     To take and bind the promising boy apprentice to a
          pilot —
     A life not bad for a hardy lad, though surely not a
          high lot,
     Though I'm a nurse, you might do worse than make your
          boy a pilot.
     I was a stupid nurs'rymaid, on breakers always
          steering,
     And I did not catch the word aright, through being hard
          of hearing;
     Mistaking my instructions, which within my brain did
          gyrate,
     I took and bound this promising boy apprentice to a
          pirate.
     A sad mistake it was to make and doom him to a vile
          lot.
     I bound him to a pirate — you! — instead of to a
          pilot.
     I soon found out, beyond all doubt, the scope of this
          disaster,
     But I hadn't the face to return to my place, and break
          it to my master.
     A nurs'rymaid is not afraid of what you people call
          work,
     So I made up my mind to go as a kind of piratical maid-
          of-all-work.
     And that is how you find me now, a member of your shy
          lot,
     Which you wouldn't have found, had he been bound
          apprentice to a pilot.</p>
