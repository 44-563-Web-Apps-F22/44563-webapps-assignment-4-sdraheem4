    The two words were so much alike!</p>

    <h6 class="fre"> FRE:</h6>
            <p class="speech"> They were.  They still are, though years have rolled
              over their heads.  But this afternoon my obligation
              ceases.  Individually, I love you all with affection
              unspeakable; but, collectively, I look upon you with a
              disgust that amounts to absolute detestation.  Oh! pity
              me, my beloved friends, for such is my sense of duty
              that, once out of my indentures, I shall feel myself
              bound to devote myself heart and soul to your
              extermination! </p>

    <h6 class="all"> ALL:</h6>
             <p> Poor lad â€” poor lad!  (All weep)</p>

    <h6 class="kin"> KIN:</h6>
              <p>  Well, Frederic, if you conscientiously feel that it is
              your duty to destroy us, we cannot blame you for acting
              on that conviction.  Always act in accordance with the
              dictates of your conscience, my boy, and chance the
              consequences.</p>
